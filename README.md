# Data Representation Project

**Student:** Ciaran Whyte </br>
**Student ID:** G00254624 </br>
**Module:** Data Representation and Querying </br>


##Introduction

This project was designed as part of a Data Representation module. In the project I have to design an API for a data set, not implement it. I will be designing the URLs for querying a particular data set for useful information, keeping in mind the needs of the users that will use the API. The API will be provided through HTTP. Each of the URLs will be described in detail explaining certain points like what kind of data will be returned from the URL and what kind of HTTP method(s) we are using.

##The Data
The data set i will be using contains data about the variety of public parks located around Galway city. Exercise is vital today for good health from both a physical and mental perspective. Therefore i find it very important that people should be aware of the different facilities they have in their local area.
